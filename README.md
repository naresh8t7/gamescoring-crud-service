# Baseball and Softball Scoring Service

We want you to build a simple baseball and softball score keeping REST API that mobile and web clients can use to save information about games. In its first iteration the service should provide endpoints to allow consumers to store and retrieve basic information about games and game events (like pitches and balls).
